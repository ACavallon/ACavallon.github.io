<p>Data Science and AI are usually expected to guide decision making, which in causal inference terms means making an intervention: adjusting price or targeting this verses that customer segment, and so forth. An intervention is an alteration to the status quo. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we aren’t able to observe what has never happened. So we can’t observe the result of an intervention until we make that intervention. Where there’s risk involved, we don’t want to intervene without sufficiently anticipating the result. Thus we want to infer in advance that the result we desire can be caused by our intervention. That entails making inferences about the causal effects of events that aren’t yet fact. Instead, such events are counterfactual, that is, contrary to fact. This is why counterfactuals have been couched, by Judea Pearl and others, as the <strong>fundamental problem of causal inference</strong>.
So the idea of a “thought experiment”, which has been important especially in philosophy — and ever more so since Ludwig Wittgenstein popularized it —as a way to probe how we use language to construct our understanding of the world — isn’t just a sentimental wish-upon-a-star.⁹ Quite to the contrary: counterfactuals are the crux of hard-headed decision making.</p>
